            <h4><u>Developer</u></h4>
            <p>Hello! I‚Äôm Tamanna Dubey, a curious mind fueled by creativity, code, and caffeine. I believe technology isn‚Äôt just about systems ‚Äî it‚Äôs about crafting experiences that feel smart, seamless, and inspired. Currently pursuing a B.Tech in Computer Science & Engineering (AI & ML),
                 I‚Äôve already built dynamic web interfaces, trained machine learning models, and launched AI-powered apps that solve real-world problems.<br>
                My internship with IBM Generative AI unlocked a fascination with foundation models, WatsonX, and prompt engineering ‚Äî giving me a front-row seat to how cutting-edge tools shape 
                intelligent content. Whether I‚Äôm styling a sleek portfolio with Typed.js or fine-tuning an NLP-based Fake News Detector, I balance precision with imagination.<br>
                I specialize in blending beautiful design with bold functionality. From HTML to Python, from UI challenges to ML pipelines, I dive into every build with excitement and intention. And while I love clean logic and tidy code, it‚Äôs the spark of innovation and the thrill of seeing something come alive that keeps me pushing forward.
